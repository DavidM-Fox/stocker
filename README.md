# stocker
A desktop application built with C++ and Qt5 for viewing historical stock data pulled from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/). This application was created to showcase an example implementation of [avapi](https://github.com/DavidM-Fox/avapi) and [QCandlestickChartView](https://github.com/DavidM-Fox/QCandlestickChartView).

# Prerequisites
Before using stocker, an Alpha Vantage API key must be retrieved from [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key). This key can be saved to an ```api.key``` file within the project root directory or entered on the home page of stocker. In addition, this application requires the following libraries:
* [avapi](https://github.com/DavidM-Fox/avapi)
* [rapidcsv](https://github.com/d99kris/rapidcsv)
* [libcurl](https://github.com/curl/curl)
* [QCandlestickChartView](https://github.com/DavidM-Fox/QCandlestickChartView)
